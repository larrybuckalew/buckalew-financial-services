                <h2>1. Starting Too Late</h2>
                <p>One of the most critical mistakes is delaying retirement savings. The power of compound interest means starting early can dramatically increase your retirement funds.</p>

                <h2>2. Underestimating Expenses</h2>
                <p>Many people fail to account for healthcare costs, inflation, and lifestyle maintenance in their retirement planning.</p>

                <h2>3. Ignoring Diversification</h2>
                <p>Putting all your investments in one type of asset can expose you to unnecessary risk. A diversified portfolio is key to long-term financial stability.</p>

                <h2>4. Overlooking Tax Implications</h2>
                <p>Understanding the tax consequences of different retirement accounts can help you optimize your savings strategy.</p>

                <h2>5. Not Adjusting Your Strategy</h2>
                <p>Your retirement plan should evolve with your life stages. Regular reviews and adjustments are crucial.</p>
