      <h2>Life Insurance</h2>
      <p>Life insurance is an essential tool for protecting your loved ones financially in the event of your unexpected death. It provides a death benefit that can help cover expenses, pay off debts, and support your family's future.</p>
      
      <h3>Types of Life Insurance:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Term Life Insurance</strong>: Provides coverage for a specific term, typically 10, 20, or 30 years. It offers affordable premiums and is suitable for temporary coverage needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Whole Life Insurance</strong>: Provides lifelong coverage and includes a savings component called cash value. Premiums are higher than term life insurance, but the policy builds cash value over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Universal Life Insurance</strong>: Offers flexibility in premiums and death benefit amounts. It combines permanent coverage with an investment component.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Benefits of Life Insurance:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides financial security for your loved ones in case of your untimely death</li>
